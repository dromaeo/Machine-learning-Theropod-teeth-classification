# Machine-learning-Theropod-teeth-classification
Python project

This project has been done in python roughly following the pipeline presented in https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/spp2.1487 

It reads the two presented files, 'fulldataset' for the training data and 'UK bathonian teeth' as the dataset to classify.
